# Learn Python like it's French

Confession: I haven't actually learned French. I _have_ learned Hungarian, but
"Learn Python like it's Hungarian" would've been a less slick title. Close enough.

A couple of weeks ago I decided that I ought to learn
[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) and
thought, hey why don't I try to apply some of my language-learning Secret Pro
Techniques! I'm already fluent in a
[couple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language))
[other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) scripting languages which
means that much like when learning to speak a second language, I don't need to
learn how to _program_, merely how to express myself in an unfamiliar syntactic
and semantic environment.

| **Step 0**:<br />Prime your brain to learn a new language                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Learn [the alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_alphabet) and all the sounds. Practice sounding out some words                                                                                                                                                 | Skim the [Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Step 1**:<br />Map the most common symbols back to the language you already know                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | I made [flashcards](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) for the 200 [most commonly spoken words](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists/Hungarian_wordlist) in Hungarian (words like "the" and "also") and mapped them to their closest English counterparts      | I made flashcards for the [most salient language features](https://hyperpolyglot.org/scripting), mapped to their closest JavaScript/Ruby counterparts                                                                           |
| **Step 2.a**:<br />Figure out how you want to get value from the language and start imitating that context. Spend the majority of your time doing this                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | I wanted to learn Hungarian for casual use while traveling, so I hired a tutor on [italki](https://www.italki.com/) and we role-played simple scenarios like buying food from a supermarket                                                                                 | I intend to use Python for writing multi-threaded programs, so I wrote a very simple web crawler                                                                                                                                |
| **Step 2.b**:<br />Keep track of and review your mistakes. Don't use someone else's flashcards. When you make your own flashcard you forge a special bond with it                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Whenever I made a grammatical mistake or didn't know a word, I'd ask my tutor to write it down. After the lesson each item became a flashcard                                                                                                                               | After each toy program I wrote, I'd review my code and look at my search history to find knowledge gaps. Each faux pas, mistake, or search became (you guessed it) a flashcard                                                  |
| **Step 3**:<br /> Branch out! You can't master a compound exercise like [deadlifts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlift) by doing just deadlifts, forever. You have to mix in some [accessory movements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerlifting#:~:text=Accessory%20movements%20are%20used%20to%20complement%20the%20competition%20lifts.). Surprise weightlifting analogy! | I found several small ways to work Hungarian into my daily life from different angles. I labeled all the objects in my apartment. I started listening to Hungarian music. I started speaking with my grandmother in Hungarian. I subscribed to r/hungary (not recommended). | I read the source code for some popular Python packages (e.g. [requests](https://github.com/psf/requests)). I asked my friends for their best Python trivia. I solved some classic programming programming problems on leetcode |

Am I pushing the limits of the analogy between spoken languages and programming languages?
Probably! Still, I think this framework was helpful in getting me to to a reasonable
degree of comfort with in Python in only a couple of weeks. If you have any
super cool language learning pro tips, please [share them](mailto:keri@warr.ca)!
